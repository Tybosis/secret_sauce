# Secret Sauce

by Tyler Pottle

## Description

This project is a secret message encoder/decoder.  To use this app, a user
should first enter a message they want to protect into the textarea on the
home page and click the lock down button.  Then a modal will appear asking
for a password.  After the password has be entered, a new url  will appear,
which the user can copy and paste into the url bar.  This url will take them to
the decrypt page.  Here, the user simply clicks the decrypt button,
enters the correct password, and the encrypted message will appear!
