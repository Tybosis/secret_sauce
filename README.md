# Secret Sauce

by Tyler Pottle

## Description

This project is a secret message encoder/decoder.  A user can enter
a message into the textarea on the secret_sauce.html page and providing
a password.  Then a new url will appear in the textarea field, which
the user can copy and paste into the url bar, which will take them to
the decrypt page.  Here, the user simply clicks the decrypt button,
enters the correct password, and the encrypted message will appear!
